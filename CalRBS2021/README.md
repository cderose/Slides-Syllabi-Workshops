## Day 1: Data in the Humanities

In our first day, we will discuss the digital humanities (DH) generally, with a focus on how we can use DH methods to pursue humanities research questions. We'll also start thinking about data â€” how do we find, create, and prepare it for analysis, and what gets lost in the process?

## Day 2: Data Visualization

In our second day, we will consider strategies and best practices for visualizing data that take into account what kind of data we have, who we have in mind as our audience, what story we're aiming to tell, and where we think the visualization will circulate. We'll also get hands-on experience producing data visualizations with Tableau Public.

## Day 3: Text Analysis

In our third day, we will cover computational text analysis (what it is, why it might be useful, what to watch out for). While we will survey a number of approaches and tools, we will focus our workshop on Named Entity Recognition in particular as that can be helpful for creating datasets that you might want to use later in the week.

## Day 4: Network Analysis

In our fourth day, we will continue our closer look at digital humanities methods by turning to networks. As with text analysis, we will start by discussing what networks are and when and why they might be useful. We will then create a dynamic network graph using Gephi.

## Day 5: Spatial Analysis & Publishing

In our fifth day, we will look at what we could do with geographic data, from how we can collect it to ways we might visualize it. As a capstone to our week, we will also discuss how we can share digital projects online.
