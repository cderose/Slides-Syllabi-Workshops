## Day 1: Data in the Humanities

In our first day, we will discuss the digital humanities (DH) generally, with a focus on how we can use DH methods to pursue humanities research questions. We'll also start thinking about data â€” how do we find, create, and prepare it for analysis, and what gets lost in the process?

## Day 2: Data Visualization

In our second day, we will consider strategies and best practices for visualizing data that take into account what kind of data we have, who we have in mind as our audience, what story we're aiming to tell, and where we think the visualization will circulate. We'll also get hands-on experience producing data visualizations with Tableau Public.
