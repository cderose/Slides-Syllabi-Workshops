# Navigating the Gephi Interface

The Overview screen is where you'll spend most of your time in Gephi. This is where you can experiment with different layouts, color or resize nodes according to some property or measure, run statistics, and partition the network based on a parameter you select.  

If you ever remove one of the windows on the Overview screen or need to reset how they're sized, click on the "Windows" toolbar at the very top of your computer screen, and select "Reset Windows."

The Data Laboratory is where you can import, edit, and view your data. Although they don't look like buttons, you can click on "Nodes" and "Edges" to move between the two spreadsheets.  

When importing your data into Gephi, begin with the node list first ("Add node" button), followed by the edge list ("Add edge" button).

The Preview screen is where you can prepare your network for publication. It gives you some design control over the look of your network (for example, how the node labels appear and whether the edges are curved or straight). Keep in mind that design choices affect the interpretability of the network.

There are two buttons to be aware of on this page:
- Refresh needs to be clicked to first view the network in the Preview screen and then to view any changes you make to the Presets.
- Export SVG/PDF/PNG lets your export a copy of your visualization so that you can either keep designing it in other tools (like Photoshop or Illustrator) or so you can have a static image that you can add to a paper or website.
