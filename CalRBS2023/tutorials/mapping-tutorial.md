## Old Maps Online Georeferencer

### Georeferencing maps
[Old Maps Online](https://www.oldmapsonline.org/partners/georeferencer/) is one resource you can use for georeferencing a map (or really, any image). The limitation is that you can only georeference one map for free.  

To get started, sign in and click on My Maps. From there, you can upload an image of the map that you want to georeference.  

After it uploads, you'll be taken to the screen where you can place pins (or points) for establishing points of connection between the two maps. (If that page didn't redirect there by default, click on My Maps and then Georeference.  

In general, you want to place between six to ten pins, far apart from one another.  To place a pin, click on one of the maps and then click one the corresponding spot in the other map.  

You'll see the georeferencer software start to make predictions after you've placed a few pins. It might also try to rotate the image.  

Click Overlay at any point to see how the map is doing. From Overlay, you can adjust a slider to set the transparency of the overlaid map.  

When you're happy, click Save.
